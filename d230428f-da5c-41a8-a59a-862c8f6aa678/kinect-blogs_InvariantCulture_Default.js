The result of volunteer efforts by Andrew Spooner and Mike Taulty, both of Microsoft UK, the display uses Kinect for Windows technology to engage passersby and inform them about the needs of people in rural Africa&mdash;and, in the process, it encourages them to make a micro-loan to help finance small businesses in developing countries.</p>\n<p>Spooner, whose wife works for <a href=\"http://www.deki.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Deki</a>, a UK nonprofit that provides microfinance to entrepreneurs in underdeveloped African countries, came up with the idea. He enlisted his colleague Taulty, and together they created a mockup of an African store that is actually run by one of Deki&rsquo;s loan recipients. The display was set up in the atrium of the Engine Shed, a hub for tech startups in Bristol, England, where its colorful graphics grab the attention of passersby, inviting them to take a quick quiz about the economic realities in developing countries like Uganda.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img title=\"The interactive display is housed in a mockup of an African store that is actually run by one of Deki&rsquo;s loan recipients.\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/503x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-49-02/7288.Deki_2D00_microfinance1_2D00_503px.png\" alt=\"The interactive display is housed in a mockup of an African store that is actually run by one of Deki&rsquo;s loan recipients.\" /><br /><span style=\"color: #808080;\">The interactive display is housed in a mockup of an African store that is actually run by one of <br />Deki&rsquo;s loan recipients.</span></p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s where Kinect for Windows comes into play. About six feet in front of the display are three large squares on the floor, marked A, X, and B. The user is instructed to stand on the center square (the one marked X). The virtual storekeeper then asks the user to choose answers A or B in response to a series of brief questions pertaining to economic conditions in rural Africa. The user indicates his or her answers by moving to either square A or B, and the ever-watchful Kinect sensor detects the response and provides appropriate feedback. The BBC ran the following report on the interactive display.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kinectforwindows/archive/2015/10/16/kinect-interactive-display-invites-charitable-support.aspx\">(Please visit the site to view this video)</a></p>\n<p>In reality, the correct answers are pretty obvious: the intent isn&rsquo;t to actually test the user&rsquo;s knowledge but rather to drive home some key facts about what it&rsquo;s like to support a family in the developing world. For example, users learn that although women in Africa make up 60 percent of the rural workforce and produce 80 percent of the food, they receive only 10 percent of the region&rsquo;s income. Or that households in the developing world spend up to 20 percent of their income on primary education.</p>\n<p>The use of Kinect technology is key to engaging users, all of whom are busy tech entrepreneurs scurrying through the atrium on their way to somewhere else. Few would be likely to stop and spend a few minutes answering questions on a touchscreen display. But a simple game of hopscotch? That can get the attention of even the most harried would-be tech mogul.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img title=\"The display highlights some key facts about what it&rsquo;s like to support a family in the developing world.\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/503x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-49-02/3482.Deki_2D00_microfinance2_2D00_503px.png\" alt=\"The display highlights some key facts about what it&rsquo;s like to support a family in the developing world.\" /> <br /><span style=\"color: #808080;\">The display highlights some key facts about what it&rsquo;s like to support a family in the developing world.</span></p>\n<p>The quiz game ends with one final question: &ldquo;Do you want to find out how you can change a life?&rdquo; Those who move to square A (that is, answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo;) are invited to submit their email address by SMS so that Deki can get in touch with them.</p>\n<p>Deki has been delighted with the response to the Kinect-powered display, noting that both lending and website traffic have gone up since its launch. And the BBC news coverage provided a public relations bonanza for Deki and its mission to support entrepreneurs in developing countries.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Spooner and Taulty donated their time under a Microsoft UK program that lets employees spend three days a year on charitable work.</p>\n<p><strong>Key links</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.windows.com/en-us/kinect\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about Kinect for Windows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.windows.com/en-us/kinect/hardware\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about the latest Kinect sensor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/139907525\" target=\"_blank\">Watch the BBC report on the Deki interactive display</a></li>\n<li>Follow us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KinectForWindows?sk=wall\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KinectWindows\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div><hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" /></div><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10648366\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">","Month":"October","Year":"2015","Day":"16"},{"title":" Can Kinect replace the white cane?","link":"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kinectforwindows/archive/2015/10/09/can-kinect-replace-the-white-cane.aspx","pubDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2015 17:30:00 GMT","creator":"Kinect for Windows Team","description":"<p>Technology has offered tantalizing prospects to replace the white cane&mdash;the traditional low-tech accessory that people who are blind use to detect obstacles in their path. Researchers have experimented with systems based on sonar and on lasers, and while some of these have shown promise, they all require highly specialized and often costly hardware. Now, a multinational team of researchers&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/17076061/\" target=\"_blank\">Nadia Kanwal</a> of Pakistan,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/91062014/\" target=\"_blank\">Erkan Bostanci</a> of Turkey, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/96092072/\" target=\"_blank\">Keith Currie</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/82650843/\" target=\"_blank\">Adrian F. Clark</a>, both from the UK&mdash;has developed a prototype system that uses the Kinect sensor, a battery, and a laptop PC, a readily available and comparatively inexpensive combination.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;<img title=\"The prototype system is strapped to the user&rsquo;s body; for the production model, the researchers envision a smaller apparatus.\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/503x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-49-02/1121.vision_2D00_prototype_2D00_modified_5F00_503px.png\" alt=\"The prototype system is strapped to the user&rsquo;s body; for the production model, the researchers envision a smaller apparatus.\" /><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><br />The prototype system is strapped to the user&rsquo;s body; for the production model, the researchers<br /> envision a smaller apparatus.</span></p>\n<p>The new system uses the Kinect sensor&rsquo;s infrared depth sensing capabilities and its RGB video camera to provide information on objects and their distance from a person who is blind or has low vision. It works like this: once its infrared and video sensors have been calibrated, the Kinect sensor&rsquo;s RGB camera detects the corners of objects in its field of view. This data is correlated with data from the depth sensor, and the result provides information about the presence of an obstacle ahead and its distance from the user.</p>\n<p>Lead researcher Kanwal, an assistant professor of computer science at Lahore College for Women University, has spent years exploring the use of adaptive technologies to assist people with special needs. Speaking about the potential value of the Kinect-based system, she says, &ldquo;A blind person wants to adapt anything that makes them more independent in mobility; therefore, a system that can identify and warn about potential hazards would be much appreciated.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Kinect-based system checks for two types of obstacles: those, such as walls, that can completely block a person&rsquo;s progress, and smaller ones, such as chairs, that can be avoided by changing direction. When an obstruction is detected, the system warns the user to either stop (so he doesn&rsquo;t run into a wall) or move right or left (so she can navigate safely around a piece of furniture).</p>\n<p>The system is carried on the user&rsquo;s body; much of the equipment is transported in a backpack or shoulder bag, while the Kinect sensor is strapped to the front of the user&rsquo;s body. While the researchers acknowledge that this setup is cumbersome, they envision a smaller, more portable production model.</p>\n<p>The research team tested the prototype with a blindfolded, normally-sighted subject and then with a subject who has been blind since birth. Both participants successfully navigated through a test environment filled with various objects. Interestingly, the blind participant felt that the system would be most useful when combined with the traditional white cane, whose sweeping action can detect smaller objects and changes in the walking surface that the Kinect-based system misses. Conversely, the Kinect system can detect large objects sooner and thus can help the user traverse more smoothly through a crowded space.</p>\n<p>The researchers used the Kinect for Xbox 360 in their prototype, but are anxious to incorporate the latest sensor, the Kinect for Xbox One, which offers improvements in both depth sensing video resolution.</p>\n<p>Although the researchers have more work to do on the system before it is production ready, the ability to use Kinect for Windows to effectively and inexpensively combine video and depth information offers great potential to help users move more freely through their environment. It might not replace the white cane, but it could go a long way toward complementing it and making the world more navigable for people who are blind.</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em>The Kinect for Windows Team</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key links</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.windows.com/en-us/kinect\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about Kinect for Windows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.windows.com/en-us/kinect/hardware\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about the latest Kinect sensor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/abb/2015/479857/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the original research paper</a></li>\n<li>Follow us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KinectForWindows?sk=wall\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KinectWindows\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10646882\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">","Month":"October","Year":"2015","Day":"9"},{"title":"Gesture control in Unity via Kinect for Windows","link":"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kinectforwindows/archive/2015/09/25/gesture-control-in-unity-via-kinect-for-windows.aspx","pubDate":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 16:37:00 GMT","creator":"Kinect for Windows Team","description":"<p>Are you developing a Unity app and wish you could easily add gesture control?

The newest first-person shooter game for Xbox? Nope. What you have is one of most carefully designed physical therapy (PT) systems available: Kinapsys.</p>\n<p>Created by RM ing&eacute;nierie, a French company that designs and develops software for the healthcare industry, Kinapsys uses game-based exercises to provide comprehensive functional rehabilitation of PT patients. Patients simply stand or sit in front of the Kinect sensor and the monitor while they play games that entail movements that are tailored to each patient&rsquo;s therapeutic needs. For example, a patient who has undergone knee ligament repair can play a game on a virtual walking trail. As the onscreen avatar strolls along, the patient must squat and move laterally to help the avatar avoid objects that hang from above or protrude from the side. Those movements are beneficial for restoring knee function.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kinectforwindows/archive/2015/09/11/kinect-aids-physical-therapy.aspx\">(Please visit the site to view this video)</a></p>\n<p>The Kinect sensor captures the patient&rsquo;s movements and transfers them to the avatar. More importantly, the sensor precisely tracks the position of the patient&rsquo;s joints and compares his or her range of movement against prescribed goals that the therapist has entered into the system. At the end of the game, the patient receives a score that allows both patient and therapist to measure therapeutic progress accurately.</p>\n<p>While the games are at the heart of the therapy, Kinapsys offers other interactive modalities that ensure that patients perform the exercises correctly. Here, too, Kinect-enabled interaction is an essential component. In every case, patients see their own image on screen, with their tracked joints superimposed. Depending on the therapist&rsquo;s choice, patients might see a mirror image of themselves, which allows them to practice the moves and receive immediate feedback on their performance. Alternatively, they might see an avatar that provides feedback on the speed and rhythm of their exercise movements, or they might interact directly with a game interface.</p>\n<p>Programmed with more than 400 specific exercises, Kinapsys allows the therapist to create a regimen customized for each patient at every stage of their therapy&mdash;from the earliest stages of rehabilitation through the reinforcement of reacquired skills. The system provides exercises and games that facilitate such goals as improved joint movement, muscle toning, gesture reprogramming, flexibility, and cardiovascular fitness. It also features programs that address the specific PT needs of patients with back problems and neurological damage from strokes. In addition, Kinapsys provides group therapy modules, and the system can be purchased in a mobile configuration, complete with a cart that lets the physical therapist transport Kinapsys to assisted living facilities, community centers, or anywhere that it&rsquo;s needed.</p>\n<p>But what really sets Kinapsys apart from traditional physical therapy is the Kinect sensor&rsquo;s ability to track body movements precisely. This enables the system to measure and chart patient progress with far greater accuracy than ever, and allows the therapist to modify the regimen for maximum patient benefit.</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em>The Kinect for Windows Team</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key links</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.windows.com/en-us/kinect\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more about Kinect for Windows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://portail.rmingenierie.net/en#concept\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about Kinapsys</a></li>\n<li>Follow us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KinectForWindows?sk=wall\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KinectWindows\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10641102\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">","Month":"September","Year":"2015","Day":"11"},{"title":"Globetrotting via Kinect","link":"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kinectforwindows/archive/2015/09/02/globetrotting-via-kinect.aspx","pubDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2015 16:00:00 GMT","creator":"Kinect for Windows Team","description":"<p>In his novel, <em>Around the World in Eighty Days, </em>Jules Verne celebrated the technological marvels of the nineteenth century&mdash;the railways, steamships, the Suez Canal&mdash;that made it possible to circumnavigate the globe in less than three months. This spring and summer, the Museum of Communication in Frankfurt, Germany, is honoring Verne&rsquo;s classic tale in an exhibit entitled &ldquo;Around the World in 80 Objects: the Jules Verne Code.&rdquo; Among the objects capturing a lot attention is a Kinect-enabled interactive map of the world, which allows museum goers to use intuitive gestures to pan, zoom, and switch between different maps and map views as they take their own trip around the globe.</p>\n<p>Created by Aleksandr Shirokov&mdash;a graduate student at the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of M&uuml;nster&mdash;the interactive digital map is displayed on a screen measuring 1.75 meters by 2.10 meters (roughly 6 feet by 7 feet). Museum visitors can pan the maps by moving one hand. They can zoom in and out by using the pinch gestures familiar to smartphone users&mdash;except that they use both hands rather than their thumb and index finger. They can also use a unique gesture&mdash;passing one hand behind an ear&mdash;to switch perspective and to view different map types.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kinectforwindows/archive/2015/09/02/globetrotting-via-kinect.aspx\">(Please visit the site to view this video)</a></p>\n<p>Museum goers can circle the world, like Phileas Fogg, the hero of Verne&rsquo;s novel, but in seconds rather than weeks. Or they can focus on a particular location, even to the point of zooming in on their own residence&mdash;just by using simple hand gestures that Kinect for Windows captures and interprets. Users are captivated by the map&rsquo;s wealth of information and by the simplicity of navigating its many views. &ldquo;That was amazing,&rdquo; enthused one recent museum visitor. &ldquo;I never really thought about how easy and natural it would be to control something with my hands.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The first iteration of the interactive map used the original Kinect sensor to capture users&rsquo; gestures. After the Kinect v2 sensor became available, the developers were eager to take advantage of its higher resolution camera and more detailed body tracking. These enhancement allowed far more precise recognition of users&rsquo; gestures, enabling users to control the map more naturally and smoothly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even need to explain to people what to do. They naturally start scrolling, changing, and zooming the map,&rdquo; notes a museum employee. And since the latest Kinect sensor can &ldquo;see&rdquo; in even a completely dark room, the new version of the app can accurately track users&rsquo; body joints&mdash;and hence their gestures&mdash;even if the lights are dim.</p>\n<p>After Frankfurt, the exhibit is scheduled to be displayed at the Museum of Communication in Berlin, where its interactive map should engage and delight a whole new group of virtual globetrotters. Meanwhile, developer Shirokov plans to use Kinect for Windows&rsquo; ability to detect heart rate and facial expressions to measure users&rsquo; emotional response to the interactive experience and then enhance the application accordingly.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">&nbsp;<em>The Kinect for Windows Team</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key links</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.windows.com/en-us/kinect\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about Kinect for Windows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.visitberlin.de/en/event/02-22-2015/in-80-dingen-um-die-welt-der-jules-verne-code\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more about &ldquo;Around the World in 80 Objects\"</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=kinectv2sdk\" target=\"_blank\">Join the Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0 technical forum</a></li>\n</ul><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10638934\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">","Month":"September","Year":"2015","Day":"2"},{"title":"All the info, in lots more languages!","link":"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kinectforwindows/archive/2015/08/28/all-the-info-in-lots-more-languages.aspx","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2015 22:44:00 GMT","creator":"Kinect for Windows Team","description":"<p>As we promised earlier this week, Kinect for Windows information for developers has migrated.
